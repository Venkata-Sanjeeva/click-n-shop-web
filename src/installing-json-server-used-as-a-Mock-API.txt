Step 1: Install json-server
If you haven't already installed json-server, you can use npx to run it directly or install it globally.

Option 1: Using npx
You don't need to install anything permanently; you can run:

npx json-server --watch users.json --port 5000
Option 2: Install it globally (optional)
If you plan to use json-server frequently:

npm install -g json-server
Then you can start it using:

json-server --watch users.json --port 5000
Step 2: Create a users.json File
Create a users.json file that will act as your data store. Here's an example:

{
  "users": [
    { "id": 1, "username": "user1", "email": "user1@example.com" },
    { "id": 2, "username": "user2", "email": "user2@example.com" }
  ]
}

Step 3: Start the Server
Run the following command in the terminal where the users.json file is located:

npx json-server --watch users.json --port 5000
This command starts a mock REST API server at http://localhost:5000.

Step 4: Endpoints Available
The json-server will automatically create endpoints based on the data in the JSON file. For the above example, these endpoints will be available:

GET /users - Retrieve all users.

GET /users/:id - Retrieve a specific user by ID.

POST /users - Add a new user.

PUT /users/:id - Update an existing user.

DELETE /users/:id - Delete a user.

You can use these endpoints to handle your API requests.
